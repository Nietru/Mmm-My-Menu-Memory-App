## Description

The My Menu Memory App is a RESTful API JavaScript program created using Node, express, mySQL, express, Handlebars HTML, and passportJS. As a User, the app should allow you to login or sign-up for an account and store recipes on your user-profile. Given more time, we would have liked to use passport to allow the user different methods of authentification for logging in, such as Google and/or Facebook, and a way for people to share their recipes on different platforms.

## Installation

```
In the terminal:
- In the root directory run [npm i] to install all necessary dependencies.
- In the db directory run [mysql -u root -p] after adding your .env file and sql information locally.
- In the db directory (within mysql>) run [source schema.sql] and source the seed file if necessary.
- In the root directory run [npm run devStart].
- Open your local host PORT!
```
